        <p>
        Seems like this is the first time that You are logging into the project.
        </p>

        <p>
        Please keep in mind that the <b>Demo</b> mode is turned on, thus the <b>Discord webhooks</b> and <b>E-mails</b>
        accounts are generated automatically and are fake ones (won't work), so If You want to test the project You
        need to define working / correct api endopoints or mail accounts data.
        </p>

        This popup is shown only upon first login.

        Have a nice day,
